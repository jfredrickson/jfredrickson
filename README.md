I'm a software engineer working with the [GSA Service Delivery team](https://github.com/GSA/service-delivery). I've spent two decades doing my part to shift federal agencies to user-centered digital services.

In [college](https://www.rit.edu/), I studied system administration and web development, and to this day I still enjoy working in both tracks: as a software engineer, I build web apps. I've always been interested in infrastructure and platform engineering, and had the opportunity to work on [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) for a while.
